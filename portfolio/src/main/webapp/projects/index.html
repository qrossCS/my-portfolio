      <h1>Software Experience</h1>
      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <p>C++, Python, HTML, Swift</p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <h3>Stat Market Simulator</h3>
      <p>
          (Febuary 2020) Using C++ I worked individually to build a program that
          simulated the actions of a stat exchange. The primary focus of this project was
          the use of Priority Queues to determine the timing of each transaction.
          The most challenging as well as my favorite feature to implement was the 
          range finder, which had the job of determining the best time to buy a sell during
          open market hours in order to maximize profits.
      </p>
      <h3>Drone Delivery System</h3>
      <p>
          (April 2020) Using C++ I implemented a delivery system algorithm that utilized the tsp 
          algorithm to map the best route efficient drone delivery. The primary focus of this 
          project was using graph algortitms to determine optimal routes with the challenge of
          restricted flight areas as well as no fly zones.
      </p>
      <h3>Insta485</h3>
      <p>
          (Febuary 2021) Using Python, I implemented a server-side dynamic mock of instagram for web browser.
          Using flask and jinja, this program connected to a database to get information which
          was then used to render html templates to produce instagram web pages that included posts,
          comments, likes and followers. As well as used flasked sessions to handle
          different users and logins. 
      </p>
      <h3>Fakebook</h3>
      <p>
          (Febuary 2021) Using SQL, I along with a partner created a database modeled after the functionality
          of the facebook platform. This included users, messages, photos and more tied together through 
          relational tables.
