      <h2>Staying Active</h2>
      <p>
          I like to stay active in many different ways including lifting weights regularly, playing basketball and running.
          I have played basketball all my life and developed a love for the sport in all aspects, playing,
          watching and of course as a topic of discussion with friends. Below are a couple pictures of my during
          my high school basketball career as well as a picture of my from my track and field days prior to a race 
          senior year. I ran track as a sprinter from 7th grade to graduating high school.
